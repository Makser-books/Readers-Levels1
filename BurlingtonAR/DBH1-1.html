Pod and Homily Clock and their 13-year-old 
daughter Arietty are 'borrowers' — little 
people, only 20 cm tall.They live under the 
floor and 'borrow' things from the humans 
in the big house above them.The entrance 
to their home is under a grandfather clock 
— so they are called the 'Clock' family. Life 
is comfortable, but a little boring ... especially 
for Arietty. She wants to go into the big 
garden and explore. She wants to play with 
other children. Then a human boy comes to 
live upstairs. It's dangerous for a borrower 
to meet a human ... but lonely Arietty wants 
a friend. Is it possible?" onmouseover="this.width=145;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=150;this.height=190" width="150" height="190"></a></p>

Set in England in the year 1900, this 
is the story of the Brown family and 
their six naughty children. The 
children create chaos and because of 
this, their nannies never stay. The 
agency doesn't want to send any more 
nannies to the Browns. 'Those children 
need Nurse Matilda,' they say. But who 
is she? Nurse Matilda is a very strange 
lady with a magical stick. Her nose is 
like a potato and she's got a big, 
terrible tooth. Nurse Matilda doesn't 
accept the children's bad behaviour. 
Very soon, she transforms their lives
with her special type of magic — and 
nothing is the same again." onmouseover="this.width=145;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=150;this.height=190" width="150" height="190"></a></p>

There's a new boy at school called Mats and 
the other kids are curious about him. He's 
from Sweden and he's very clever. He works 
hard in class and seems nice, but he doesn't 
mix with the other kids after school. He never 
invites anybody to his home and he looks so 
scared when his father collects him from school 
every day. What dark secret is he keeping?" onmouseover="this.width=145;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=150;this.height=190" width="150" height="190"></a></td>
