This book contains eight kind and wise parables. You will 
find a deep meaning in simple words. These tales were 
created in different parts of the world: Russia, America, 
Burma, China, Egypt, Mexico, Guinea and India. The first 
story tells us about a woodcutter and his ill son. The boy 
asks his father to bring him a bird. It is his last desire. 
The next tale is about a baker, who wants to get payment 
even for the smell of his perfect baked goods. You will 
also learn about a young man who dreams to become an 
alchemist and make gold from dust. A Chinese old man will 
teach you wisdom. He always says “Good luck, or bad luck 
who knows”. It is true, as we never know how the things 
will turn out even if everything seems good. Another tale 
is about a man. He desires to become very rich and makes a 
business plan." onmouseover="this.width=155;this.height=185;" style="cursor: pointer;" onmouseout="this.width=160;this.height=190" width="160" height="190"></a></td>
